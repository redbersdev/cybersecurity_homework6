  the permissions of this account an attacker might be able to:

  - gain access to sensitive files

  - upload or delete files.","If you do not want to share files, you should disable anonymous
  logins.","","A host that provides an FTP service may additionally provide
  Anonymous FTP access as well. Under this arrangement, users do not strictly need an account on the
  host. Instead the user typically enters 'anonymous' or 'ftp' when prompted for username. Although
  users are commonly asked to send their email address as their password, little to no verification
  is actually performed on the supplied data.

  Remark: NIST don't see 'configuration issues' as software flaws so the referenced CVE has a
  severity of 0.0. The severity of this VT has been raised by Greenbone to still report a
  configuration issue on the target.","

  keys. The Arcfour cipher is believed to be compatible with the RC4 cipher [SCHNEIER]. Arcfour
  (and RC4) has problems with weak keys, and should not be used anymore.

  - The 'none' algorithm specifies that no encryption is to be done. Note that this method provides
  no confidentiality protection, and it is NOT RECOMMENDED to use it.

  - A vulnerability exists in SSH messages that employ CBC mode that may allow an attacker to
  recover plaintext from a block of ciphertext.","Checks the supported encryption algorithms (client-to-server
  and server-to-client) of the remote SSH server.

  Currently weak encryption algorithms are defined as the following:

  - Arcfour (RC4) cipher based algorithms

  - none algorithm

  - CBC mode cipher based algorithms

  NOTE: The script preference allows to set one or more custom SHA-1 fingerprints of CA certificates which are trusted by this routine. The fingerprints
  needs to be passed comma-separated and case-insensitive:
